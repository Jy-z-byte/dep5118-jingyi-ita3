        <h4>——MRT Walk Stress Crowdsourcing Project</h4>
        <p>
            This project investigates pedestrian movement, congestion, and stress levels around MRT stations. By leveraging crowdsourced data, we aim to identify high-stress areas, analyze walking conditions, and propose potential urban planning improvements. The interactive map below allows users to explore real-time reports submitted by the community. You can also submit your own experience by clicking the plus sign on the map.
